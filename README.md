#Call For Volunteers

Hello!
 
Coder Dojo Indy is helping Girls Inc with their annual summer camp again this year!  We are looking for volunteers who are familiar with basic computer programming to help guide a small groups of girls through 
 
* understanding what makes a game a game
* designing their own small video game
* implementing their game in Scratch (helping break parts of the game into chunks that the girls can do and working on it on your own to pull it together in a playable form)
 
We will use Scratch, a visual programming environment designed for kids, to build the games, Scratch is intuitive and easy to learn.
 
We'll probably be doing some Human Computer activities as well in order to help them understand computing concepts like decision structures and iteration.
 
We'll be working with 25-30 girls between the ages of 9-11
 
Time commitment:
June 22 TBd time for volunteer introductions and light training, we'll provide a meal if the time hits a meal time.
June 23 - 27th, 9:15am to 11:30am.
 
Location:
Fall Creek Academy
2540 N Capitol Ave, Indianapolis, IN 46208
 
Please email jon.nolen@gmail.com if you can commit to volunteering! 
 
Please consider asking for that time from your employer if you are interested but feel like the time makes it undoable.
 
Thanks,
 
 
Coder Dojo Indy organizers!
