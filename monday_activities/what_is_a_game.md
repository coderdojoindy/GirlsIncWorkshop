# What is a game?

Everyone knows a game when they see one but what makes a game a game?

+ a goal
+ rules that govern how you can achieve that goal.

plus other things:
+ a setting
+ and some form of conflict or obstacle.



Soccer:

The goal is to score more points than the other team.

Rules:  
+ Where you play.
+ how a goal is scored
+ How you can interact with the ball.
+ Where you can be on the field.
+ How many people there are on each team.
+ How you can interact with people on the other team.

Obstacle, conflict or challeng:
In sports, the obstacles are usually the other team. Since you have to score more points 
than them and there is only one ball you have to do two things: 

1. keep them from scoring points
2. score points for your team.

That is where the challenge comes in because both teams are trying to do those things
at the same time, within the rules of the game.
