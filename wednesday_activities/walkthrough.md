### Create a main character
1. Select an existing sprite to use as your main character
2. Create a script that makes the sprite follow your mouse left/right across the screen
3. Run this script when the flag is clicked

### Create a falling object
1. Select another existing sprite to use as the (good) falling object
2. Drag the sprite to the top of the screen
3. Create a script that moves the sprite to the bottom of the screen
4. Make it fall straight down no matter where you start
5. Make it move to the top and fall again when it hits the bottom
6. Hide the object when it hits the bottom and show it when you move it to the top
7. Run this script when the flag is clicked

### Create a score
1. Create a score variable
2. When the falling object touches the main character, hide it and add 10 to the score
