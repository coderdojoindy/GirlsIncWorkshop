# Decisions

Having the computer execute a series of instructions is great, but it isn't very useful, the computer will do the same thing over and over and over and over every time you run it.  You can have your program do different things based on the answer to a question.  This is done with an **IF** statement.  An **IF** statement looks at a question that can be answered with Yes or No and then tells the computer which line of instructions to start executing next.

### Unplugged
This time we are going to play a game called if/else. There will be a leader who will make an if/else statement then call out start to have everyone perform that statement. 

We will do a group example: "if your favorite color is green, do a dance, else hop"
Our second example: "if you had cereal for breakfast run to the left side, else run to the right side."

We will then split them up to groups. Have girls control the rest of the group for one example (ask after if they get the idea). Then have them use if/else to sort themselves by age. Then sort by height. (Note, this is not the time to discuss sorting strategies/algorithms. They will eventually come to a strategy like if you are Jane move right).

### Scratch

+ add a green flag clicked event.
+ drag out an if - else block from control
+ drag a > block from operators into the if statement expression container
+ drag a [x position of sprite 1] block from sensing into the left side of the [>].
+ drag a [move 10 steps] block to the inside of the if clause, change 10 to -10
+ drag a [say] block to just below the move block in the if clause make it say "to the left!"
+ drag a [move 10 steps] block to the inside of the else clause.
+ drag a [say] block to just below the move block in the else clause make it say "to the right!"
