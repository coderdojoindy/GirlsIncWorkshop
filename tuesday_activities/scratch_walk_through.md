+ drag a `greater than` block into the `if else` expression.
+ drag a `x position` block from sensing onto the left expression of the `greater than` block.
+ click on the right expression of the `greater than` block and type `0`.
+ drag a `move steps` block in between the if and the else in the `if else` block.
+ click on the `move steps` expression and change it from `10` to `-10`.
+ drag a `say` block to just below the `move steps` block inside the `if`.
+ click on the `say` expression and change it to `to the left!`
+ drag a `move steps` block to the inside of the `else`.
+ drag a `say` block to just below the `move steps` block in the `else`.
