# Computers do EXACTLY what you tell them to

A computer reads one instruction after another and then does what that instruction tells it to.  Exactly what that instruction tells it to do, no more, no less.  We are going to see how this works by moving a Turtle around a room.

### Unplugged

+ Setup
  + groups of about 10
  + need 1 "computer"
  + need 1 "turtle"
  + everyone else is an "instruction".
+ Execution
  + put the turtle in some open space.
  + have each instruction choose between one of three options
    + move the "turtle" 1 step forward
    + turn the "turtle" right
    + turn the "turtle" left
  + line the "instructions" up (any order)
  + the "computer" visits each "instruction" in order, gets the command and then makes the "turtle" do the action.
+ Repeat by re-ordering the instructions, or having a different girl be the turtle and computer.

### Scratch

+ Add a series of move 10 and turn instructions to a sprite in Scratch.
